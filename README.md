# Learning-Git

I am starting to learn git since it has been very difficult for me merge things in the master branch and i have to ask my senior every time i do it. 


The commands which i have used here are. 

A ---> git add filename  (to add the particular file)
B ---> git add .  (to add all the files)
C ---> git commit -m "Message for the commit"
D ---> git status (to view the status of all the fils what are the changes and all)
E ---> git log  (to see the commit history and the info where head and latest commit is)
